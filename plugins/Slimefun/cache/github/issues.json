建议内容\r\n清理世界的命令很有用，希望你们可以添加，比如：\r\n- 清理所有世界保存的数据：`/sf cleardata * *`\r\n- 清理所有世界保存的原油开采数据：`/sf cleardata * oil`\r\n- 清理指定世界保存的数据：`/sf cleardata world *`\r\n- 清理指定世界保存的原油开采数据：`/sf cleardata world oil`\r\n\r\n甚至可以扩展到清理区块的命令：\r\n- 清理指定世界特定区块保存的数据：`/sf cleardata world 0 0 *`\r\n\r\n### 添加的理由\r\n- **资源世界友好**：有些服务器拥有资源世界，但是玩家不老实，会放一些粘液科技方块，导致世界刷新后存在幽灵方块；或者启用了异域花园的植物生成，也会导致清理世界后留下植物和树的幽灵方块。\r\n-
